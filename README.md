# Who we are

The Institute of Paradise Engineering (IPE) is dedicated to the alleviation of suffering and the co-creation of a more loving, connected, and equitable future. We envision a future grounded in gradients of sublime bliss, where all sentient beings can enjoy an unprecedented level of fulfillment, safety, and healing.

We are a team of researchers, students, and community members from [Princeton](https://www.princeton.edu/), [Harvard](https://www.harvard.edu/), [Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/), and the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/) dedicating our lives on Earth to the co-creation of this vision.

If you would like to get involved, we invite you get in touch at `ipe.paradiseinstitute@gmail.com`.

Towards Infinite Bliss,
IPE
